While Unstoppable, you:\n\n- Gain resistance to physical damage.\n\n- Add an additional d6 to any damage rolls you make.\n\n- Can spend stress to reroll any single die you've rolled.\n\nAnytime you roll your damage dice, reduce the Unstoppable die value by one. When you would reduce the value below 1 or the scene ends, remove it and drop out of Unstoppable. At Level 3, upgrade your Unstoppable die to a **d6**. At Level 7, upgrade it to a **d8**."
