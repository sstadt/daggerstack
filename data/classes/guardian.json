Place it on the spot to the right, starting with the “1” value facing up. Whenever you deal one or more hit points to an adversary, increase the Unstoppable die value by one. When you increase the value above the die's highest number or when the scene ends, remove the die and drop out of Unstoppable. At Level 3, upgrade your Unstoppable die to a **d6**. At Level 7, upgrade it to a **d8**.\n\nWhile Unstoppable, you:\n\n- Gain resistance to physical damage\n\n- Add the current value of the Unstoppable die to your damage dice total\n\n- Increase your current Armor Score by your Proficiency\n\n- Cannot be Restrained or Vulnerable"
